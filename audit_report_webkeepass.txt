### Analysis of Database Model

#### Table: wkpSeqCrypt
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** The column `Seq` allows NULL values, which might be critical if it's supposed to be a sequence number.
  - **Expected Fix:** Alter the column to not allow NULL values.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE wkpSeqCrypt ALTER COLUMN Seq INTEGER NOT NULL;
    ```

#### Table: wkpPasswordCrypt
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** The primary key is missing, which is essential for identifying records uniquely.
  - **Expected Fix:** Define `PasswordID` as the primary key.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE wkpPasswordCrypt ADD PRIMARY KEY (PasswordID);
    ```

#### Table: wkpPasswordAKin
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** `PasswordID` should likely be a foreign key linked to `wkpPasswordCrypt`, but it's not defined as such.
  - **Expected Fix:** Add foreign key constraint.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE wkpPasswordAKin ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PasswordID FOREIGN KEY (PasswordID) REFERENCES wkpPasswordCrypt(PasswordID);
    ```

#### Table: wkpGroups
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** `PrntID` should be a foreign key if it refers to another group or entity.
  - **Expected Fix:** Define `PrntID` as a foreign key if applicable.
    ```sql
    -- Assuming PrntID refers to another group in wkpGroups
    ALTER TABLE wkpGroups ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PrntID FOREIGN KEY (PrntID) REFERENCES wkpGroups(KeeperID);
    ```

#### Table: wkpCryptHistory
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** Similar to `wkpPasswordAKin`, `PasswordID` should be a foreign key.
  - **Expected Fix:** Add foreign key constraint.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE wkpCryptHistory ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PasswordID FOREIGN KEY (PasswordID) REFERENCES wkpPasswordCrypt(PasswordID);
    ```

#### Table: wkpBundle, wkpAccess
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** No primary keys or foreign keys defined, which are essential for data integrity.
  - **Expected Fix:** Define primary keys and any necessary foreign keys.
    ```sql
    -- Example for wkpBundle
    ALTER TABLE wkpBundle ADD PRIMARY KEY (BundleID);
    -- Add foreign keys if applicable
    ```

#### Table: ownerChanges
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **No issues identified:** This table seems to have appropriate primary and foreign keys.

#### Table: jrUsers
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** `GroupID` should be a foreign key if it refers to `jrUserGroups`.
  - **Expected Fix:** Add foreign key constraint.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE jrUsers ADD CONSTRAINT FK_GroupID FOREIGN KEY (GroupID) REFERENCES jrUserGroups(GroupID);
    ```

#### Table: jrUserGroups
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **No issues identified:** Primary key is defined, and other fields are optional.

#### Table: jrGroupAccess
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** `GroupID` should be a foreign key linked to `jrUserGroups`.
  - **Expected Fix:** Add foreign key constraint.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE jrGroupAccess ADD CONSTRAINT FK_GroupID FOREIGN KEY (GroupID) REFERENCES jrUserGroups(GroupID);
    ```

#### Table: jrBUnits
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **No issues identified:** Primary key is defined, and other fields are optional.

#### Table: dtproperties
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **No issues identified:** This table seems to have appropriate primary and foreign keys.

#### Table: documents
- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Data Integrity Issues:** `UserID` should be a foreign key linked to `jrUsers`.
  - **Expected Fix:** Add foreign key constraint.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE documents ADD CONSTRAINT FK_UserID FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES jrUsers(UserID);
    ```
